<p>This is like what Spotify comes up with at the end of the year, except I made it myself.</p>
<p>I've learned I need to build and write. They're both important to me. Building apps makes me a better writer, and technical writing makes me a better developer. Here's what I've been up to this year on each of these fronts, plus a few other notes.</p>
<h2>Building</h2>
<h3>Write Things</h3>
<p><a href="https://3dvkr.github.io/write-things/" target="_blank">Write Things</a> (<a href="https://github.com/3dvkr/write-things" target="_blank">Source Code</a>) is a React app that helps you write in a carrot-on-a-stick sort of way—you'll get a new picture every few words you write. You can select how often you'd like the app to do this. You can write plain text, or code with syntax highlighting.</p>
<h3>Rapt</h3>
<p><a href="https://rapt-app.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Rapt</a> (<a href="https://github.com/3dvkr/rapt" target="_blank">Source Code</a>) is a full-stack app built with Node, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It's a time-tracker that lets you annotate your Pomodoro sessions, and provides a visual summary of your work using the D3.js library. The app uses server-side rendering with EJS, a templating language. Users register and log in using local authentication.</p>
<h3>Task Lemon</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/100devs/course-tracker">Task Lemon</a> is a full stack MVP that's <em>almost</em> ready to ship. I wrote some internal docs, and several pages on the <a href="https://github.com/100devs/course-tracker/wiki">project's wiki</a>. It's tailored for instructors who want to run courses without a syllabus. This was the largest dev team project I've worked on, and I'm excited to see it used in bootcamps and workshops and conferences.</p>
<h3>Yes, But How?</h3>
<p>This is <a href="../blog-rebuild">the blog you're reading right now</a>! I made it from scratch with a static site generator, Eleventy. It was one of my early ventures away from entirely imperative JavaScript code, and a good stepping stone towards mildly-to-strongly-opinionated libraries and frameworks.</p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>My <a href="../js-part3/">rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock</a> game is the post I hear about the most from some very kind people, and I hope it helps them continue on into the land of vanilla JavaScript. My post about <a href="../copilot/">GitHub Copilot</a> is my personal favourite. It's an example of supporting for new devs by leveraging some overlooked tools.</p>
<p>The rest of my posts are inspired by things I've encountered, or by questions I've gotten from others, and those questions often ended in, <em>&quot;Yes, but how?&quot;</em> It only made sense that I wrote about those discussions on this blog.</p>
<h2>Open Source Contributions</h2>
<h3>Code Thesaurus</h3>
<p>I made a <a href="https://github.com/codethesaurus/codethesaur.us/pull/157">pull request</a> that fixed a layout issue. It was my first time working with Django and Bootstrap. I figured out how to set up a local development environment on my machine, and it was my first dive into containerization and Docker.</p>
<h2>Plans for 2022</h2>
<details>
   <summary>Keep writing at least one blog post per month.</summary>
    In order to pull this off, I'll need to keep the conversation going with developers at all levels. There's only so much I can discover and discern on my own. Book clubs and reading in general help a lot too. </details>
<details>
   <summary>Keep building apps.</summary>
    The driver for this might be checking out new libraries and frameworks. I don't necessarily need to do a deep dive into every single one, but knowing what's possible can be a source of creativity. It's okay if most of these apps never see the light of day. There are other ways for the effort to pay off.</details>
<details>
   <summary>Start reaching out to more people.</summary>
   I'm an introvert, through and through. With the pandemic, I'm rusty when it comes to navigating new social settings. It's going to be uncomfortable, but I need to remember it's also rewarding. </details>

<p>Thanks for reading! I hope it was useful. I'd love to hear your thoughts over on <a href=https://twitter.com/_dvkr>Twitter</a>.</p>
