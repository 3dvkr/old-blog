# Yes, But How?

*Yes, But How?* is my tech blog. It's built with Eleventy, a static site generator, and is deployed using GitHub Pages. The templates use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The main branch is my code for generating *Yes, But How?*

The `gh-pages` branch contains the `dist` output folder from Eleventy's `npm run build` command, and contains the webpages that get served.
